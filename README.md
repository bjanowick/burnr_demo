# burnr_demo
Educational demonstration of the burnr R package

To obtain a copy of this R project and run the code on your machine, you will need to fork the repository.

In RStudio, go to File > New Project, and choose “Version Control”, select “Git”, and paste the repository url:
 https://github.com/chguiterman/burnr_demo.git
 
Select where you want the project to live. The project includes the set of folders containing data and scripts that you see on this github page. 

After a moment, you should see the folders in the "Files" tab of your Rstudio console.

You can now open and run the code. The datasets are housed within the project, so R will know where to find them.

If you'd like to contribute to this demo page, please fork the repository and submit pull requests. See here for more info: http://r-bio.github.io/intro-git-rstudio/
